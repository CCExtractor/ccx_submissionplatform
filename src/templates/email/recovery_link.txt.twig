Dear user,

there has been a request to reset your password.

To change your password you need to click on the link below, or copy it into the browser:

{% autoescape false %}
{{ base_url }}{{ path_for("My Account_recover_step2", { "id": user.id, "expires": time, "hmac": hmac }) }}
{% endautoescape %}

Attention! This link is only valid for two hours after the request has been made, and can be used only ONCE to reset the password!

If you did not request this password reset and you suspect an intrusion attempt, please get in touch through the website.
